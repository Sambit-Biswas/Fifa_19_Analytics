# # Business Understanding
# Being a football fan and local famous striker means exploring FIFA19 player datsset could be so much fun.
# 
# I will focus on the three question below:
# 
# Q1: What's the ratio of total wages/ total potential for clubs. Which clubs are the most economical ï¼Ÿ
# 
# Q2: What's the age distribution like? How is it related to player's overall rating?
# 
# Q3: How is a player's skils set influence his potential? Can we predict a player's potential based on his skills' set?

# For Q3, we will drop those player rows since there were just too many missing values here.

# From the result and plot, it's obvious that the 'Giant' clubs including Real Madrid, Bacelona, and clubs from EPL are willing to spend much more wage for high potential players than average clubs. This is how they stay competitive in leagues.
# 
# But surprisingly, the economical clubs are not clubs from nowhere that we never heard of. Some of them are even quite famous like AEK Athens, Dynamo Kyiv. This suggests that those clubs' players are potiential but underpayed. It maybe a good approach for 'Giant' clubs to import more econimical players from them to reduce their overall wage spent.

plt.show()


# From above plot, we can see that most players are between 20-26 years old. And players' number start to decrease after 26 years old and speed up after 30. Reason behind this could be that many young player didn't get enough opportunities to prove themselves and give up their dream as a football player.
# 
# When a football player reaches their late 20s, they have gain enough experience and reaches peak of their rating. The golden era of a football player starts here and ends when his age reaches 35. At this age, his physical body condition drops quickly so as average rating.
# 
# There are also quite a few numbers of players with age over 37, 38 years old. This is quite a surprise especially their rating still can remain quite high.
